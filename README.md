# Python Environments and Best Practises Live Training

This is the code for the *O'Reilly Live Training* - **Python Environments and Best Practises** presented by Arianne Dee

Before the class, please follow these instructions:
1. [Install Python](#1-install-python-39-or-higher)
2. [Check that Python was installed properly](#2-make-sure-that-python-is-properly-installed)
3. [Install PyCharm](#3-download-pycharm)
4. [Download the code](#4-download-the-course-files)

## Set up instructions
### 1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click the yellow button at the top to download the latest version of Python.

Follow the prompts and install using the default settings.

### 2. Make sure that Python is properly installed
Open the *PowerShell* application in Windows
or *Terminal* on Mac or Linux

Try these commands:
- `python --version`
- `python3 --version`
- `py --version`

At least one of those commands should print a Python version of 3.9 or higher 
(whichever version you just downloaded).

If it doesn't, try further specifying the version, like:
- `python3.13 --version`
- `py -3.13 --version`

### 3. Download PyCharm
Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

Install, open, and use the default settings.

### 4. Download the course files

#### If you know git:
Clone the repository.

#### If you don't know git:
1. Click the "Clone or download" (green) button at the top-right of the page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip it and move the **python-environments-main** folder to a convenient location

## FAQs

### Can I use a different code editor besides PyCharm?

You can use VS Code for this class.

Jupyter notebooks are not ideal since we'll be working from multiple folders throughout the class.

### My IDE doesn't recognize my Python version

See [these instructions](https://github.com/ariannedee/python-ide/blob/main/docs/PYTHON-IDE.md)
for setting Python up in PyCharm or VS Code.

### Do you offer private Python help?
Yes, email **arianne.dee.studios at gmail.com** if you have any questions.
